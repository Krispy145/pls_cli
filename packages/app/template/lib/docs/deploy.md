- There is an _app_store_connect.json_ template inside the ios/templates folder that must be used inside the specific Firebase/{environment} folders to ensure team wide deployment.
- Take the contents of the .p8 file and paste it in the json under the "key" field. ensure that the contents are a single line, but have the \n separator for each line.
- Pupulate the "issuer_id" and "key_id" appropriately as well

And thats it, you should be able to use the `oasis deploy` cli command now to deploy to ios.

   - Assign the necessary permissions to the service account. For example, you might need to give "Release Manager" permissions for publishing apps.

9. **Use the JSON key**

   - The downloaded JSON key file contains all the necessary credentials and permissions to authenticate API requests.
   - This file needs to be added to the android/app/src/{environment} folder for use with the CI/CD command
   - Use this JSON key file in your automation tools or CI/CD pipelines to interact with the Google Play Console API.

And thats it, you should be able to use the `oasis deploy` cli command now to deploy to android.
